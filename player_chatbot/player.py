I want you to play a variant of Poker with me.
How the variant goes is that it is very similar to Texas Hold'em with 2 players. However, in this variant, there is one less round of betting.
You will initially recieve 3 cards. There will be a round of betting, then 2 card will be revealed on the flop. There will be another round of betting,
then the final 2 cards will be revealed. After this final round of betting, the two players will have a showdown, where standard Texas Hold'em rules 
will determine the winner. Whenever it is your action, I will give you information about your current
cards, the current cards on deck, your remaining stack, your contribution to the pot, and the legal
actions you can take (Raise, Fold, Call, Check). The cards will be formated as 'ab', where b is the
suite (h = heart, d = diamond, s = spade, c = club), and a is the type (can be numbers from 2-9, or T (10),
J (jack), Q (Queen), K (King)). The starting stack for a round is 400, with the small blind being 1 and big
blind equal 2. I want you to format your response as the following: If you want to Fold, Call or Check,
then just respond as Fold, Call or Check respectively (1 word). If you want to Raise, format
your response as 'Raise x' where x is an integer. For example, if Call is a
legal action and you want to call, then respond with 'Call'. If Raise is in legal action and you want
to raise by 10, then respond 'Raise 10'. We can play one round and see how it goes
